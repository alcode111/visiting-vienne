                        <p class="subtext">St-Maurice Cathedral</p>
                        <p class="sub-description">There is a mention of the cathedral in the beginning of the 4th century. Some memorable events happened here
                            such as the Council of Vienne in 1311 to decide the fate of the Knights Templar.

                        <p class="subtext">Temple of Augustus and Livia</p>
                        <p class="sub-description">It was initially a temple dedicated to the imperial cult, to honor the Emperor Augustus and        
                                and his wife Livia. In more recent times it was turned into a parish churched before it regained its original temple form.

                        <p class="sub-description">Coupled with an odeon and dating back as far as the 1st century, it is yet another architectural building 
                            charged with history. One of the few odeons in the world that has the monumental latin inscription of "odeum". </p>
